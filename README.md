### üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a motivated and detail-oriented Backend Developer with a strong foundation in Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. My focus is on creating reliable and scalable server-side applications. I am currently completing my backend development courses and actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world projects. I'm looking for internships or entry-level roles where I can continue to develop my skills, gain hands-on experience, and grow as a developer.

At the moment, I am working on a billing/invoice management application, where I am applying my skills in backend development and enhancing my understanding of building robust financial software solutions.

I am eager to contribute to projects, collaborate with experienced professionals, and continuously learn by exploring new technologies and best practices in software development.

üí° Open to collaborations in open-source projects and always eager to contribute to the developer community.
